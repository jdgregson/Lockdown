TODO:
 [ ] install LockdownClient for all users when you install Lockdown as admin. It
     may be possible to set a task to run on logon of any user. This would solve
     most of the complexity. Just auto-run LockdownClient in the context of
     whoever logs in.
 [ ] Add a monitor and alert for cedential guard-related events -- it MUST
     resolve the process ID to the process name and path.
